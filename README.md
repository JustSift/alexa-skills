# Alexa Skills
Alexa Skills for interacting with Sift.

## Disclaimer
__*Use at your own risk! This codebase and Sift Alexa Skills are not supported by Sift.*__

This project is the outcome of a Hackathon event that Sift attended in early 2018.

The code and overall state of the project reflects that of a hackathon.
Additionally this codebase consumes an internal Sift API which can/will change
without notice. Fortunately the internal endpoint being used is a mature one and
shouldn'tâ„¢ change much

There is a Sift API in the works -- currently in Alpha. Feel free to reach
out to the Sift team with any inquires regarding SiftAPI.

## Intents

* Profile Intent: request specific attribute of a person within Sift
* Search Intent: search for a person within Sift
* Phone Intent: call a person within Sift using Twilio to connect the calls.
